This project aims to address my biggest frustration with C, which is the lack of easy access to various basic data structures.  
By undertaking this project, I hope to have a simple go-to option whenever I need something simple, and to learn something along the way.

The planned scope of this project is as follows:  
Strings  
Vectors  
Maps  
Hash Maps  
Priority Queues  

The Progress of the project is as follows:  
&emsp; Complete and Tested - None  
&emsp; WIP - Strings  
&emsp; TODO - Vectors, Maps, Hash Maps, Priority Queues
